## üé≠ Demo Script (Detailed)

### Opening Statement
```
"Good afternoon judges! I'm excited to present OnchainMind, a revolutionary dApp
that combines AI technology with blockchain identity on Circle Layer.

The problem we're solving is simple: current dApps are generic and don't learn
from users. Our solution? AI-powered NFTs that evolve with you."
```

### Technical Demonstration
```
"Let me walk you through the live demo. First, I'll connect my wallet to
Circle Layer testnet. Notice the instant connection - that's the power of
Circle Layer's infrastructure.

Now, I'll create my AI Twin NFT. This isn't just a static image - it's a
living, learning AI that will know everything about my blockchain activity.

Watch as the transaction processes. See how quickly it confirms? That's
Circle Layer's speed advantage over other L2s.

Here's my AI Twin dashboard. You can see my reputation score, level, and
personalization. The AI Twin has already started learning from my wallet.

Let me chat with it. I'll ask about my recent activity and see how it
responds with personalized insights based on my blockchain history.

Notice how the reputation system works in real-time. Every interaction
earns points, and you can see the leaderboard updating live.

The real magic happens with WebSocket connections. Watch as I make a
transaction and see everything update instantly."
```

### Closing Statement
```
"What we've built isn't just another dApp - it's the future of onchain
identity. AI Twins that learn, adapt, and provide value to users while
building reputation in a decentralized ecosystem.

OnchainMind demonstrates the power of combining AI with blockchain on
Circle Layer. We're not just solving today's problems - we're building
the foundation for tomorrow's Web3 experiences.

Thank you for your time. I'm happy to answer any questions about our
technology, architecture, or vision for the future."
